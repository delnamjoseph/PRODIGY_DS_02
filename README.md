Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset


This marks my inaugural kernel, where the primary objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset. The aim is to gain insights and ultimately predict survival outcomes (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers who embarked on the Titanic, approximately 38% survived, while the majority, 62%, did not survive the disaster.

Outlined below is the step-by-step process I followed in executing the aforementioned procedure:
1)Import Relevant Python Libraries: Import essential Python libraries necessary for the analysis.

2)Load Train and Test Datasets: Load the train and test datasets and set the index if applicable. Visual Inspection of Dataset:

3)Visually inspect the head of the dataset. Examine the train dataset to determine tidiness, shape, data types, missing values, unique counts, and construct a data dictionary dataframe.

4)Descriptive Statistics: Run descriptive statistics for object and numerical data types. Transform data types accordingly based on the descriptive statistics.

5)Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis: Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using both graphical and numerical representations.

6)Feature Engineering: Extract titles from names. Create new features from name, age, fare, sibsp, parch, and cabin.

7)Preprocessing and Data Preparation: Prepare data for statistical modeling through preprocessing steps.

8)Statistical Modeling:
